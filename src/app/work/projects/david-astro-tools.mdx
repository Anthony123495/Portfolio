## Overview

Development of a free, user-friendly web platform — David Astro Tools — tailored for astronomy and astrophotography enthusiasts. The application offers dynamic, responsive tools to simplify planning and exploration of the night sky, all in one accessible place.

## Key Features

- **All-in-One Tool Suite**: Offers a collection of astronomy and astrophotography calculators and utilities — including framing tools, visual aids, and observational planners.
- **Responsive and Interactive UI**: Designed with mobile-first responsiveness and smooth user interactions for seamless access across devices.
- **Simplified Planning Process**: Removes the need for multiple external tools or manual formulas by centralizing technical workflows into a single, intuitive experience.
- **Beginner to Expert Friendly**: Crafted to be approachable for newcomers, yet powerful and flexible enough for advanced users and seasoned astrophotographers.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for authentication, Firestore database management, and cloud hosting to ensure a secure and scalable experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**:  For building dynamic, component-based front-end architecture.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Emotion**: For applying scoped, themeable CSS-in-JS styling.
- **FireBase**: For user authentication, Firestore database, and deployment hosting.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was creating a balance between scientific accuracy and UI simplicity. Ensuring that complex astronomical formulas were accurate while keeping the interface accessible led to iterative improvements in design and tool logic. Another learning was optimizing the app for both desktop and mobile use, enhancing the user experience across all devices.

## Outcome

David Astro Tools is now actively used by the astronomy community to streamline session planning and deepen their understanding of astrophotography principles. It has significantly reduced the technical barriers for both beginners and experienced users, offering a single place to plan, calculate, and explore the cosmos — all for free.
